idk where to even start… today was so weird.
Math class was literally the WORST. i swear mr. carter singles me out just bc i never do the hw 🙄. like sorry i actually have a life???

lunch was kinda fun tho. sat with jess and emily and we laughed so hard about the thing w/ mike’s hoodie (still smells like axe lol). but then i saw him walk by… and ofc he didn’t even look at me. whatever. i’m pretending not to care but i do. ugh.

after school i just listened to MCR + paramore on repeat. every song feels like it’s about me (esp “Misery Business”).
why does everything feel so dramatic lately?? like one second i’m laughing till i can’t breathe and the next i just want to crawl under the covers forever.

anyways i’m supposed to be doing english essay rn but writing this feels more important.
k bye.
